Parallel-DataPipe version 0.02
=================================

CPAN module Parallel::DataPipe for parallel data processing conveyor 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

These should all be in perl's core:

use Storable qw(freeze thaw);
use IO::Select;
use POSIX ":sys_wait_h";

For tests:
use Test::More tests => 21;
use Time::HiRes qw(time);

If found it uses Sereal module for serialization instead of Storable as it is more efficient.
